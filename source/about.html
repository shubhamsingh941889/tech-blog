        <h3 class="font-weight-light">Hello, I’m <span class="font-weight-bold">Shubham Singh</span></h3>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Shubham Akhilesh Singh, a tech enthusiast and a Software Engineer based in sunny Los Angeles, CA. I have a deep passion for all things related to coding, web development, and cutting-edge technologies.
        <br><br>
        With a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California and a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Mumbai University, I've had the opportunity to dive into various aspects of software development and hone my skills.
        <br><br>
        Apart from coding, I love sharing my knowledge and experiences with others. That's why I've decided to create this tech blog where I can share interesting insights, tutorials, and personal experiences from my journey in the tech world. My goal is to make complex concepts accessible and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their technical background.
        </p>
        <!-- <br><br> -->
        <p>
          When I'm not glued to my computer screen, you can find me exploring the vibrant streets of LA, sipping coffee at a local café, or indulging in outdoor activities like hiking and photography. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and finding inspiration from the world around me.
        </p>

        <!-- <br><br> -->

          So, join me on this exciting tech adventure! Let's geek out together, learn, and have fun while unraveling the wonders of the digital world. Stay tuned for regular updates on my blog, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect. Cheers!
