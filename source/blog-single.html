          <p>Welcome to my tech blog, where we embark on an exciting journey through the virtual frontier. 
          <strong> Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have emerged as transformative technologies in our ever-changing digital age, transforming businesses and revolutionizing the way we view and interact with the world around us. </strong>
          AR and VR are ushering in a new era of immersive and interactive possibilities, from improving gaming experiences to transforming education and retail. 
          Join us as we explore seven fascinating ways AR and VR are altering industries, enabling innovation, and propelling us into a future where the lines between the physical and digital worlds blur. 
          So buckle in and get ready to discover the limitless potential of AR and VR in this exciting technological frontier.</p>
          
          <p>Before we dive deep letâ€™s understand the difference between AR and VR.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>AR in simple terms means you are supplementing your real world visuals with some digital content to enhance the user's perception of reality. </strong>
            AR technology superimposes computer-generated images, movies, or information onto the user's perspective of the physical environment using devices such as smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses. 
            <strong>An example of AR could be Instagram or Snapchat filters such as masks, animations, and filters, onto users' faces in real-time while taking selfies or recording videos.</strong>
            
          </p>
          <img src="images/ar-vr-post/vr.jpg" alt="post-thumb" class="w-100 img-fluid mb-4" style="object-fit: cover; height: 450px;">
          
          <p>
            <strong>VR on the other hand creates a completely simulated and immersive digital environment that isolates the user from the real world. </strong>
            By wearing a VR headset or goggles, users are transported into a computer-generated environment, shutting out their physical surroundings. 
            <strong>An example of VR could be VR theme parks that offer a variety of virtual experiences, such as virtual roller coasters, interactive adventures, and multiplayer VR games, providing thrilling and immersive entertainment.</strong>

          <p>
            <strong>Shopping:</strong> In the past, people would visit physical stores to try on products before buying, but with the rise of online shopping, there is still a significant group of consumers who prefer that hands-on experience. 
            Augmented Reality (AR) has emerged as a solution, with companies like Amazon, Gucci, ASOS, and Sephora offering AR apps. IKEA's app, allows users to visualize furniture in their homes, while Uniqlo and American Apparel provide virtual fitting rooms. 
            <strong>The global virtual fitting room market is projected to grow from $3.5 billion to $12.97 billion between 2021 and 2028.</strong>
             AR is bridging the gap between online convenience and the desire for product trial before purchase.

          <p>
            <strong>Travel: </strong>AR and VR technologies have revolutionized the way we experience travel and exploration. 
            They offer immersive and engaging experiences that can enhance or even replace traditional sightseeing.
            <strong>MARS Storytelling utilizes personalized AR experiences to bring historical sites and visitor centers to life, the National Geographic VR app allows users to kayak in Antarctica or explore Machu Picchu, offering a cinematic and sensory-rich experience. </strong>
            The growing popularity of these technologies is reflected in the market, with the global AR and VR tourism market projected to reach $11.3 billion by 2025, according to Allied Market Research.

          <p>
            <strong>Gaming:</strong> Virtual reality has transformed gaming by offering immersive experiences. 
            The global VR gaming market was valued at $7.3 billion in 2020 and is projected to exceed $22 billion by 2027. In 2019, around 2.8 million standalone VR gaming headsets were shipped globally. 
            <strong>The rise of VR gaming has led to an increase in dedicated VR gaming rooms in shopping malls and entertainment zones, providing users with interactive and engaging experiences.</strong>
